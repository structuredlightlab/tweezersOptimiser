Introduction
############

The optical tweezers toolbox can be used to calculate optical forces and
torques of particles using the T-matrix formalism in a vector spherical
wave basis. The toolbox includes codes for calculating T-matrices, beams
described by vector spherical wave functions, functions for calculating
forces and torques, simple codes for simulating dynamics and examples.

To get started using the toolbox, checkout the `Getting
Started <Getting-Started>`__ page.

Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute a feature, report a bug or request we
add something to the toolbox, the easiest way is by `creating a new
issue on the OTT GitHub page <https://github.com/ilent2/ott/issues>`__.

If you have code you would like to submit, fork the repository, add the
code and open a new issue. This method is preferable to pasting the code
in the issue or sending it to us via email since your contribution
details will remain attached to the commit you send (tracking
authorship).
